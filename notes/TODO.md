Questions for Tom:

- Do I need to add more on how I settled for config in section 7.3
- In future work section of eval you say scalability testing with future work? comment what does this mean
- What terms need defined?
- Do I need a testing summary? 

Things to do:
- Write a complete host script? (Maybe just user manual with current impl is fine?)
- Write a complete client script? (Maybe just user manual with current impl is fine?)
- Do network analysis when artificial high ping?
- Potential experiment - record tow screens one which goes through the whole thing (capture device, cables, network) and one that just has straight input from wii. Record both then press button. Check frame by frame for time difference

General diss stuff to do:
- Too fluffy - too many weasel words
- Build on the figure over time
- More detail
- More citations?

Add pictures of the setup to appendix
Make font size smaller in tables - I think the font is good now

Old to do list:
- Currently steering/acceleration is too extreme. Need to put the division scale in the python script to a higher value to make it easier to make precise tilts

- Do testing and validation and update/uncomment section 5.7 accordingly?

- Design trade offs section?
- Add a testing summary to appendix?
