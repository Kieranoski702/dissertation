- Currently steering/acceleration is too extreme. Need to put the division scale in the python script to a higher value to make it easier to make precise tilts
- Reduce emulator latency 

- Add play-rtp and boardcast-rtp code to impl chapter?
- Do testing and validation and update/uncomment section 5.7 accordingly?

- Add network latency and gather results. Basically do playability testing and add to eval chapter
- Write a complete host script
- Write a complete client script
- Add user manual/more professional README as an appendix

- Design trade offs section?
- Add a testing summary to appendix?
  
Questions for Tom:

- Word count? Is 5000-8000 a fine range for this type of project
- Kinda repeating myself a lot in report? Is that fine?
- Need to add a whole ethics chapter? Is ethics form as appendix enough to not need a whole chapter?
- Software engineering process chapter? I didn't have one and don't think it is worth talking about
- Can you read over this draft? Not done the full testing or full evaluation of gaming experience/playability
- If I get those done before the 4th of April, how many days notice would it have to be for you to look over those sections before submitting?
- How can I do playability testing? I looked at the paper which talks about interaction lag which I might be able to measure but would be hard to get the latency between the wii performing the action and seeing the action over hdmi. Other than this what other playability testing can I do?
- Do I need a testing summary?
