In this practical, I have implemented part of a compiler/translator for a small
expression language, by converting it to increasingly simple intermediate
representations, then generating executable Java code from the ANF. My solution
handles all five of the provided test programs as well as additional test
cases. In addition to this, I have made my solution particularly modular and
scalable to ensure that additional language features are handled with minimal
or no changes to the existing code. I have gone beyond the practical
specification by implementing a test suite to ensure the correctness of my
implementation to a greater extent than the provided test cases. This fulfills
both the basic and extended requirements of the specification and beyond.
