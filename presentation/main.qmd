## Problem and Motivation 

- The Nintendo Wii remains a beloved console. However, Nintendo discontinued online services for the Wii in 2014.
- Other projects have recreated the Wii’s online services, but they are limited to specific online only game modes and do not support local multiplayer titles and gamemodes.
- This project aims to virtualise the Wii’s input and output interfaces, enabling remote players to experience local multiplayer as if they were in the same room.

## Main objectives

1. Capture the Wii’s video and audio outputs and stream them to remote players with minimal latency.

2. Capture remote user Wii Remote inputs -- including motion data and button presses – and transmit them over a low-latency network connection.

3. Emulate the remote user’s Wii Remote inputs through a local Bluetooth connection to the Wii console.

## Design Overview

## Results

- The project successfully allows remote players to participate in local multiplayer Wii games.
- The overall latency is around 170ms, which is acceptable but not great for most games. 
- However, most of this latency is hardware delay from the Video Capture Card which could be reduced with more expensive hardware.
- Other limitations remain but overall the project has achieved its goals.
