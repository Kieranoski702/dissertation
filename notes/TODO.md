- Currently steering/acceleration is too extreme. Need to put the division scale in the python script to a higher value to make it easier to make precise tilts
- Currently the IR pointer/main menu pointer can only go up to about half way up the screen and can go way below it. Something is up with the IR sensor resolution or some emulator motion/input/drawing scale
- Reduce emulator latency by switching to pure byte protocol for button input?
- Write a complete installer script
- Write a complete host script
- Write a complete client script
- Add network latency and gather results
- Write report
  - Limitation: Don't support nunchuck etc but could be added
  - Limitation: Not tested more than 2 players
