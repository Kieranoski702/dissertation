\chapter{Initial Plan from the Semester 1 Final Report}
\label{appendix:plan-d2-semester1}

As mentioned in the overview, the main goal of the project is to develop Rust
native interfaces for each of the constraint solvers in order to increase the
performance of the Conjure stack by removing the reliance on plain text
communication between each part of the stack and using simple library calls
instead of spawning multiple processes. My general plan for the semester was to
learn more about Conjure and Rust, create the foreign function interface
bindings for Chuffed, and then use those FFI bindings to create some Rust
native interface for Chuffed so that it could be used in the wider conjure
oxide stack. The general marker of success was creating a Rust native interface
capable of solving the XYZ problem which is discussed more in detail later in
this report.


\section{Conjure Stack Redesign}

Figure \ref{fig:existing-tech-stack} illustrates the current tech stack, while Figure \ref{fig:new-tech-stack} presents the
proposed new stack. The new stack eliminates the necessity for plain text data
exchange, bypasses intermediaries like Savile Row, and offers a more user and
developer-friendly structure. This new stack is expected to significantly
enhance performance, streamline the system by employing a single programming
language, and provide consistent documentation and testing.
