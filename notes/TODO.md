- Currently steering/acceleration is too extreme. Need to put the division scale in the python script to a higher value to make it easier to make precise tilts
- Currently the IR pointer/main menu pointer can only go up to about half way up the screen and can go way below it. Something is up with the IR sensor resolution or some emulator motion/input/drawing scale
- Reduce emulator latency by switching to pure byte protocol for button input?
- Write evaluation
- Make data flow diagram to be used as figure in section 4.2

- Write a complete installer script
- Write a complete host script
- Write a complete client script
- Do testing and validation and update/uncomment section 5.7 accordingly

- Design trade offs section?
- Add network latency and gather results
- Add user manual/more professional README as an appendix
- Add a testing summary to appendix?
- Write report
  - Limitation: Don't support nunchuck etc but could be added
  - Limitation: Not tested more than 2 players
  
Questions for Tom:

- Word count? Is 5000-8000 a fine range for this type of project
- Kinda repeating myself a lot in report? Is that fine?
- Need to add a whole ethics chapter? Is ethics form as appendix enough to not need a whole chapter?
- Software engineering process chapter? I didn't have one and don't think it is worth talking about
- Can you read over this draft? Not done the full testing or full evaluation of gaming experience/playability
- If I get those done before the 4th of April, how many days notice would it have to be for you to look over those sections before submitting?
