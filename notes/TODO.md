Questions for Tom:

- Do you have the other half of the feedback
- Can we do experiment
- I say that wii sport original had no online play. I know this is true but I cant find a source proving the negative. How can I source this/do I need to
- Is requirements table correct format?
- Should reference to figure 1.2 in design section be a duplication of the figure instead?
- Do I need a testing summary? 
- List of tables and list of figures?

Things to do:
- Add user manual/more professional README as an appendix
- Write a complete host script? (Maybe just user manual with current impl is fine?)
- Write a complete client script? (Maybe just user manual with current impl is fine?)
- Do network analysis when artificial high ping?
- Potential experiment - record tow screens one which goes through the whole thing (capture device, cables, network) and one that just has straight input from wii. Record both then press button. Check frame by frame for time difference

General diss stuff to do:
- Too fluffy - too many weasel words
- Build on the figure over time
- More detail
- More citations?

Old to do list:
- Currently steering/acceleration is too extreme. Need to put the division scale in the python script to a higher value to make it easier to make precise tilts
- Reduce emulator latency 

- Do testing and validation and update/uncomment section 5.7 accordingly?

- Add network latency and gather results. Basically do playability testing and add to eval chapter

- Design trade offs section?
- Add a testing summary to appendix?
